                <p className='text-justify mt-4'>The most secure transition for jobs and for stable economies is that our large fuel and energy companies plan for diversification in the energy mix. This should enable them to chart a sustainable pathway and in the process to use their resources and invest in skills and redeployment of workers into renewable energy and related supply chains. This, in turn, would secure the confidence of both workers and their pension funds. Reform of such kind of climate and labor rights based policies is must needed for the justice of stranded workers as well energy transition. </p>
